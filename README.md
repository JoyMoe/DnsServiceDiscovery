# Mittosoft.DnsServiceDiscovery

A pure .Net managed API for interfacing to Apple/Bonjour's mDNSResponder service on Windows, to enable DNS Service Discovery.

The library currently implements the following operations:
- Browse Services
- Register Services
- Resolve Services
- Lookup Host Address Information

I will be adding new features in the future as time permits.

Currently only building as a .Net Standard 2.0 library.  I will add new build targets in the future if there is demand for it.

For library usage, have a look at the ConsoleApp and ServiceBrowser projects in the repo.  I will add documentation (comments) at some point in the future.

I have a fairly long TODO list associated with this project and will be updating the project in the future as time permits.

I will be adding Github-related content including CONTRIBUTING guidelines.

This is my first open-source contribution and I'm by no means a Git/Github guru, so please bear with me as I become more familiar with the community and tools.
